== Motive
This is a barebones rails project that uses 

Mongoid - for database - no activerecord included
Resque - for background processing
Unicorn - for webserver 
Foreman - for running daemons nicely
Bootstrap - Easier Templates


These are my commonly used modules and I use this project whenever I am spinning out a new repository instead of starting from rails new.

TODO: Intending to add devise, capistrano for later.
